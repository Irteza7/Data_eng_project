# Building a Weather Data Pipeline using Python, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Airflow, and Metabase

## Overview

## Overview

Data engineering is a vital field in today's data-driven world and hands-on experience is crucial to mastering its tools and techniques. My objective in undertaking this project was to build a reliable and efficient data pipeline using entirely open-source tools, thereby demonstrating that cost doesn't have to be a barrier to harnessing the power of data. In this project, I used Python, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Airflow, and Metabase to collect, store, process, and visualize weather data. This article will discuss the project's step-by-step process, insights gained, and how each tool contributed to the pipeline's successful construction. I believe this will be beneficial for those seeking to enhance their skills in the field of data engineering, especially when working with open-source tools.


## The Data Source: OpenWeatherMap API

This data pipeline starts from extracting weather data. I chose OpenWeatherMap API, a service providing weather data globally. It is reliable, easy to use, and serves a wide range of weather metrics.

## Data Extraction and Transformation: Python and Kafka

Python's easy-to-read syntax and wide array of libraries make it ideal for tasks like calling APIs and parsing responses. A Python script was used to call the OpenWeatherMap API and fetch the weather data.

Once the data was fetched, it was published to Kafka, a distributed streaming platform. Kafka served as a buffer and allowed us to decouple data fetching from data processing and loading, providing scalability and fault tolerance.

## Data Loading: Kafka to PostgreSQL

On the other side of our Kafka setup, another Python script was tasked with subscribing to the topic where the weather data was being published. This script processed the data and loaded it into a PostgreSQL database.

PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database, was chosen for its features like transactions, subselects, triggers, and views, which can be very useful for complex analytical queries and data integrity.

## Data Pipeline Orchestration: Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow, an open-source tool to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows, was used to manage the data pipeline. The Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) ran every four hours, triggering the ETL pipeline which consisted of fetching data from the API, publishing it to Kafka, consuming the data from Kafka, and storing it in PostgreSQL.

## Data Visualization: Metabase

The processed data needed to be made accessible to users in a meaningful way. Metabase, an open-source data visualization tool, was used to build interactive dashboards from the data stored in the PostgreSQL database. This allows users to glean insights from the data easily and intuitively.

## Infrastructure: Docker and Docker Compose

Every component of this project, from Kafka to PostgreSQL, Airflow, and Metabase, was managed using Docker containers. Docker ensured that the setup was consistent across different environments, making the deployment of the entire pipeline a breeze. Docker Compose was used to manage the services, taking the project to a whole new level of automation.

## Conclusion

Building a data pipeline like this involves several moving parts, each serving a specific purpose in the pipeline. But the end result is a robust, efficient, and scalable system that can handle weather data updates every four hours. This project demonstrates how different technologies can be orchestrated to achieve complex data pipelines, providing valuable insights in an accessible and user-friendly way. 

Whether you're fetching weather data like us, or dealing with another kind of data, I hope my journey can provide a roadmap for building your own data pipelines.
